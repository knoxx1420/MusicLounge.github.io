                        If the public at large still remained oblivious to the grunge community’s pervasive drug abuse, then Alice in Chains went ahead and told them all about it on 1992’s Dirt. Undisguised examples such as “Sickman,” “Junkhead,” “God Smack” and “Angry Chair” were terrifying and mesmerizing in equal measures, and similarly gloomy issues such as depression, war and mortality pervaded other key tracks “Them Bones,” “Rooster” and “Would.” All of which might have made AIC’s sophomore album a downer and a slump, if not for the haunting beauty of Cantrell and Staley’s vocal harmonies and the musical exorcism of their demons.

                        After generating plenty of buzz from their previous releases, the music world finally caught up with Deftones on their 2000 album White Pony. The Terry Date-produced record became one of the defining albums of 2000, fully realizing the potential of the band’s atmospheric quiet-loud dynamic with great aplomb. The monster radio hit was “Change (In the House of Flies),” a creepy little ditty that put Chino Moreno’s vocal capabilities on full display.

                        When's the last time a rock band released a perfect debut album? With The Door's eponymous LP, they instantly became '60s rock royalty and Jim Morrison was a definitive poet of the decade. Bookended by the classics "Break on Through" and "The End," there's zero room for fluff in this iconic album.

                        Is there any better album side than Side 1 of Led Zeppelin's 1971 classic, Led Zeppelin IV? You start with the undeniable groove of "Black Dog" followed by the unabashed rock fury of "Rock and Roll," dig into folksy "The Battle of Evermore" with Plant and female vocalist Sandy Denny, then finish out the side with the legendary epic "Stairway to Heaven." But Zeppelin weren't done, with an amazing Side 2 that included "Misty Mountain Hop," "Four Sticks," "Going to California" and "When the Levee Breaks."

                        Yeah, "Creep" is good and all, but how about "Paranoid Android" and "Karma Police"? Radiohead's OK Computer brought '90s art rock to its zenith, giving fans a flawless record that made the band's first two records, somehow, feel like child's play.

                        After proving they could move millions of copies on their own terms with Badmotorfinger, Soundgarden proved they could streamline their thorny, inimitable songwriting just enough to do it again on an even larger scale, with the stunning Superunknown. Sacrificing none of their mold-shattering individuality, the quartet simply fine-tuned virtually every song here — “My Wave,” “Fell On Black Days,” the title track — into a potential single. And the tunes that were actually chosen as official singles, primarily the muscular “Spoonman” and psychedelic nightmare “Black Hole Sun,” went on to define the grunge era, even as it neared its conclusion and fell on black days of its own making.

                        With Weezer's debut album, Rivers Cuomo became the voice of every outcast toiling on a guitar in the parents' basements. Not one note on the Blue Album can be changed, from anthemic bangers like "Say It Ain't So" to tearjerkers like "The World Has Turned and Left Me Here."
